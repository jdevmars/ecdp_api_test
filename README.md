My colleague at work wanted a JSON request body to be used inside ExpertSender Email Marketing Platform to transfer email addresses from workflows to ExpertSender Customer Data Platform. I made up my mind to create a simple Java console application for testing the ECDP API and the necessary payload that would, later on, be shared with him.

Success followed me, and the JSON body worked for him, he achieved his goal.
